"""I was an Uber driver in Raleigh,NC for 2 months a couple months after the launch just to check out what all the hype was about. First and foremost, driving for Uber is like working for about $10/hr(maybe) when you do the math. Uber charges riders in Raleigh $1.20 per mile. They pay their drivers 80percent of that or .96/mile. That is a mathmatical fact.As a driver,when you pick-up a passenger and drive them to their destination, you have to drive back to the hot pick-up area to get another fare.That's a fact. Raleigh is not New York City where you can pick up a rider,drive them across the city, and pick up another fare 5 blocks away. In Raleigh, you pick-up a rider, drive them 10 miles away,and then drive back the same 10 miles to get another fare(typically in downtown or local concerts etc). I did it and I know. I even camped out at the airport for 2 weeks from 7AM-10AM when 35 flights typically come in from big Uber markets. Very few calls to drive and I positioned myself so that I would be the first to be called because of an area I know about very close to the terminals. Back to the nasty math that Uber hates to talk about.Your .96/mile is now half that or .48/mile,because you have to drive back to pick-up another passenger. Gas in an efficient car is .15/per mile that you drive. Bro, now you are down to making .33/mile. Hardly what I call a good job part-time or otherwise considering you are wearing out your car driving people around. No BS what I have just told you here.Just the facts.1/16/2015 UPDATE!!!! Uber has now dropped their rider fees to .75/mile in Raleigh!! Amazing. Take everything I stated above regarding the money you can make at Uber as a driver and reduce it by over half now. They have added a bogus hourly guarantee(with conditions that are not within your ability to control)and have the gall to state that they are looking out for the drivers. Most drivers are actually losing money driving for Uber now,when they factor in gas and car expenses,nevermind making any money.People....You need to have your heads examined if you continue driving for Uber.

"""Just started using Uber during a trip to Seattle this Summer.  During that trip, had a chance to use Uber about a dozen different times.  Then a half dozen trips in Portland, Oregon.  Just got back from a trip to New York, where I used Uber extensively, as well as a few rides on a \""Yellow\"" cab.  In every case, Uber was extremely convenient.  The vehicles were always on the new side, clean and comfortable.  The drivers were prompt, helpful (provided us with walking directions, information on places to check out, and warnings about areas that were \""sketchy,\"" etc).  Because your ride is paid for automatically via the app, there is never any fumbling with cash, credit card reader systems, etc.  Just get to your destination and go._x000D_The iPhone app is a breeze to set up and use.  It allows you to chose the type and size of vehicle you need, lets you know how long you will have to wait for your ride, and gives real-time location updates on the Uber you have requested.  It also gives you the name and customer ratings of your driver before you book the ride, notifies you as soon as your Uber arrives to pick you up, and allows you to contact your driver via cell if there are any issues.  You are always asked to rate your last driver before you can book a new ride, which assures that Uber has extensive customer feedback, but can slow things down a bit if you are trying to book your next ride in a hurry._x000D_Our experience using \""Yellow\"" cabs in many cities has not been great.  By and large, have always experienced long wait times when booking a cab by phone.  The standard seems to be \""your cab will be there in 15 to 45 minutes.\""  Usually, this works out to be 30 minutes plus.  Have also had issues with cabbies not wanting to do business with me when my ride is only a couple of miles or less.  In one case, had a cabbie whose car wouldn't start until AFTER we had gotten out of his car and jumped into another cab.  The cabs always seem to be \""vintage\"" - at least five years old  - poorly maintained and on the gritty side.  Our last experience with a cab ride was from La Guardia to New York's financial district.  It was like the Long Beach Grand Prix meets destruction derby.  Lots of jackrabbit starts, swerving in and out of traffic at high speed, slamming on brakes - all in a car that hadn't seen new shock absorbers in about a decade.  My wife and  I were both motion sick, but were too freaked out by our fast and furious driver to try fixing our eyes on the horizon._x000D_All-in-all, I am sold on Uber.

Well I wasn't drunk just super buzzed.. I notice this guy is taking a diffrent route like way off and he got off far from where my address was and was driving so slow but I don't say anything. Until the next day when I see my receipt not only did my heart stopped seeing how much I got charged 194 dollars plus the ten from the other driver, I was soo angry and the time on the receipt said 2:00 to 5:00 am so this guy didn't turn off his uber, he probably thought she's drunk she won't notice..well I was trying to fight for this because what this guy is a scam like I get it we all need money but too step this low to get money is not correct. Soo after a few messages with uber there only going to give me $100 back but I am still going getting charged $86 like wtf that's still too much and after being super angry and what that driver did I don't want too pay anything..I don't think I'll be using uber anymore shady money hungry people.""",2,379,1571,2016-01-17

This was at the suggestion of the Comfort Inn Suite and we were happy with the service that was provided to the Port of New Orleans. Mileage of 14.34 and drive time of 36 minutes as recorded with a value of $21.78. On our travel from the Best Western Plus on St Charles Ave to the Louis Armstrong airport on Feb 19 was a total of 15.77 miles and a trip time of 31 minutes and with a fare charge of (adjusted by Uber from $44.11) $39.07 is still $17.29 more than our first ride with only a difference of 1.43 miles and 5 minutes. It took two weeks to get a response back from Uber. This is unprofessional.  We had explained in detail on the cost of all three of our trips with Uber, and the last trip, we where over charged, due to the driver taking a longer route. Plus the driver was on the phone with his wife when driving.  In Louisiana, law prohibits talking on your phone while driving, that is called \""Distracted Driving\"" and the driver put us in harms way and insurance companies like to hear about this when it comes to distracted drivers.    We said that I will call both Hotels, and complain, we also said that I will get a hold of Uber Head Office, plus go on social media, and do a negative review, plus do a negative review on the Uber app.  My husband and I are very upset on how this has been handled, with the Uber company in New Orleans to a point that they stop returning emails, even with the Uber app.That is a very expensive 1.43 miles and 5 minute ride. The first refund proposed by Uber was $.29 we find to be a joke and totally inadequate and we were hoping that Uber would reconsider a more substantial refund.  They have refunded us so far around $10.  When checking the distance to the airport it should've been $28.00.  Since then we have not heard from Uber. Specially with the last email asking for the email for head office.So we are done with the games, will be posting this note on all social media to let everybody know be aware of Uber ripping customers off and for their safety.

They drive off because you can't find them and you get charged for the ride and another late fee. There are no human beings available to talk to when you have problems.

Uber is also a very good company that treats its drivers with great respect.  The Uber app for Driver Partners is simply amazing and has evolved to include trip details, earning summaries and great rewards that rival many US Fortune 100's offerings.  As to earnings, Uber provides a real opportunity for drivers to make good money doing a highly rewarding job on a full-time or part-time basis.  At first, Uber will enter a market with a much lower price than the taxi services to help boost the customer base but they are also smart enough to know that price increases are also necessary to reflect the higher level of service that Uber delivers while still providing personal transportation at lower prices than taxis.  With the latest revolution in Kansas and Missouri Taxi Code to solidly position Uber in Kansas City for the longterm, drivers should expect to make hourly rates in excess of $30 per hour due to increased demand.

One day you might get a ride with someone who speaks the same language as you and is driving a clean vehicle that isn't dented, rusting or doesn't stink like the 9th circle of hell inside but that will be a RARE day if you ever do.  Secondly, If you find yourself outside of their preferred pick up areas, you are not going to get a ride or you will wait longer than you wold have for a taxi or legal rideshare.  Third, THERE IS NO INSURANCE.  Uber is falsely advertising that they actually have insurance, their TOS page invalidates any and all coverage for you once you get in the vehicle.  Fourth, their surge pricing scam is obviously NOT about a lack of supply or demand or they wouldn't be dropping the surge price once a few of their drivers have picked up people at THREE times the normal rate in the same area.  It is a method of keeping their vehicles in one area so Uber can collect more fees from their drivers.  It has nothing to do with customer service or actual demand and it destroys the green factor of the service as it puts twice as many vehicles on the road than would be needed.  This isn't even a real rideshare company. It is just a crappy point to point service.

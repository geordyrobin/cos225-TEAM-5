"""March 2015 I took a trip to New York. A coworker suggested I try the Uber app. Trip one, the pick up at the airport, the driver was sitting in the wrong place and expected me to walk to him at the other end of the terminal. Trip 2 a short ride from my hotel was $20, when a yellow cab for the same trip was $8. The driver again stopped midway down the block and parked in front of another hotel. It took him 25 minutes to find me, when the APP showed his car making circles around the blocks nearby. Trip 3 the driver did not know where to go to find Broadway and Lafayette. Uber drivers use their personal cars to pick up a few fares. They don't know the normal taxi protocols, and it cost be double or more for each local ride. Yellow Cabs are still a great service, with professionals who may not have fancy black cars, but have expertise in driving.""",1,1999,853,2015-04-02

I drove for 6 hours last night and I made like $90, and I was busy. See, while one can get a lot of riders, many just want to hop a few blocks away, which is not worth it for the driver at all. The fare will be just about $3.20 or so, or $5.50? Taking into account that maybe I drove more than a few blocks to pick up that rider just to take him/her 5 blocks away?  Minimum flat fee should be at least $6 to make it worth picking them up. I actually have a rider whose fee was $3.20. But the driver has no way to know in advance these things, otherwise I won't pick up that person.  Let's do the math, last night I made 90 - %20 to uber = 72, now 72 - 17gas = 55. Now 55 - 10 a day for car lease = 45 Now $45/ 6 hours shift = $7.5 which is less than minimum wage. Sure there are nights or days when you get a bit more, but that still be around $12/hour, other days average pay might be $15/hour or so, but no where near $35 an hour. In addition, if my car goes over the mileage limit from the lease I will pay 15 cents a mile and driving for Uber my car WILL go over the limit. Uber, should increase the prices to make it worth for the drivers, and riders before you complain the driver this and that and before you give such a low ratings, think about the privilege you have by using Uber, and how this ride might be at the drivers expense.""",1,2053,1492,2014-03-30

"""I drive for Uber in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I keep my car clean, inside and out, and often receive compliments on cleanliness. Uber drivers cannot be called from a time of more than 15 minutes from the pick up point, unless there is no other driver in the area. I have been called at 16 minutes without surge pricing. Speaking about pricing, in the Milwaukee area, the minimum charge is currently $5.25 (Uber X), of which the driver receives $3.20. The rate is based on $1.20/mile and $0.20/ minute (Uber X). Passengers often call Uber X when they should be calling an XL, but are rarely turned away. This does not give them a right to complain on that part. Customers are given estimates of the cost, as long as they put in the destination, and are notified if it is surging. They are allowed to cancel at any time, even after I arrive, without penalty. Fares can vary based on route taken, construction delays, accidents, and other traffic delays. I  end the trip immediately, as per Uber policy, when I mess up on the route, get stuck in traffic, or if the customer gets upset because of the trip. The customer is my number one priority, and I treat every passenger the way I would want them to treat me. The large part of my ridership is intoxicated college students, and they often get rowdy in my car. It takes alot of patience, which gets trying, to keep professional. If this doesn't sound like a job for you, please, don't apply to drive. I agree that there are problems with Uber, most freqently is due to GPS location with dropped pins. I suggest to manually enter your location of pick up and drop off, and contact your driver as soon as you get a conformation and verify your location. I notify all my passengers, when I arrive, of the address I am at to confirm my location is where they want me. For passengers, if you are expecting an Uber to arrive, please be ready, look for a message, and respond promptly. Drivers are paid per completed trip, not per hour, and do not make money sitting and waiting. Which is why I only wait 5 minutes after I arrive, unless the customer contacts me, responds to my message, or asks me to wait. I often get into a surging area, for pick up, and have to wait for a customer who never shows or cancels after I have been waiting. This is upsetting because I could be out picking up an actual person who needs my service. Drivers do not know where your destination is until he starts the trip, so we cannot decline to take you anywhere until we have already started the trip, after which we are committed to following through because the app does not allow us to cancel a trip in progress. I have never turned away a customer based on destination, nor for them needing my trunk space. I have picked up customers from grocery stores and helped them with their groceries, even carried them inside for them. I have picked up people for the airport and loaded and unloaded their luggage, and wished them a safe trip! In Milwaukee, Uber does not have privileges to pick up at Mitchell International Airport, or at least Uber X's. I often make trips from the downtown area to Waukesha, New Berlin, Greenfield, Grafton, Oak Creek, and Pewaukee. These fares are typically between $13 to $26 on non-surge rates. Those trips are between 15 and 25 minutes one way. My take on these trips average out to about a dollar per mile and Uber takes the rest.""",4,2082,3387,2015-11-30

"""This is a follow up to my previous review. In Dallas Uber has further increased their cut of the total take while reducing the cost of a ride. Now Uber charges 80 cents per ride, a dollar and 70 cents for their fee per ride which they take off the top and 20 percent of what is left. Thus a minimum ride (a ride under 4 miles) will attract an Uber charge of $5. The driver gets a gross of 2 dollars and 60 cents while Uber takes 2 dollars and 40 cents. If you are unlucky enough to give a ride to an SMU student, the would order you to take them to a fast food place usually a mile or one and a half away. They make you go through the drive through. If it is whatasaburger be sure you will spend anywhere between five to ten minutes waiting in line with your car running. Afterwards they eat in the car, spill drinks, food, leave trash, and jump out of your car after you drive them back with out tipping. Guess how much is your gross? It is a wopping 2 dollars and 60 cents. I used to get so worked up about it, and I am not usually able to hide my feeling about it such that I usually get a 1 star rating from those students. Somebody would say if you hate it so much why not quit. I will tell you why. I joined Uber 2 years ago. At that time my second wife had just died of multiple sclerosis. I still had two teenagers and an 11 year old at home. I had to find something that would be flexible. At that time Uber was advertising $35 dollars an hour for Uber X. If you really do the math you will realise that even if it was true, it is not much. Because the amount was merely gross. And the hourly mentioned was driving hours after you have picked up a client. It does not include the time spent in your car running the engine and waiting for Uber call. Neither does it include distances driven to pick up passengers. If the client cancells after you get there then it does not count. So I decided that Uber black was the way to go. You make fewer rides and much more money. So I contacted Uber. Asked about car requirements. With their approval I took 48, 000 dollar loan to buy a car. When I tried to register it as Uber black I could not. I sent an email and h ot a reply encouraging me to register it as Uber X and then open another email and register it as Uber black. I tried to do that but it was all a lie. A year later somebody at Uber finally told me that they stopped registering Uber black in the same month that I was asking them if it was okay to buy my car to use as Uber black. To cut the long story short I had to run the car as Uber black. Later Uber came up with Uber Select and they let me register and for a while it was better. Uber sellect cost about twice the cost of Uber X. I switched to only Uber Select. Pretty soon Uber ordered all Uber Select to also do X or be turned off. Then t hey systematically began to kill off Uber Select business by always surging the price of Uber select. The alternative is to flip burgers, but it will not pay for my 900 dollar a month car loan. So I am forced to spend a gazillion hours (at least twelve) to be able to earn anything between 100 and 200 dollars gross per day. Thete that is why am still doing it until I find an alternative. What irks me most is the fact that everbody blames the drivers. The press make Uber drivers the villain. They do not know the city, they are not curteous, they are dishonest, etc. But who advocates for them? Who sincerely wonders how they make ends meet? What about the American tradition of tips? Why should it not apply to Uber drivers? Some will say why do they do it if it is so bad? I have told you my reason. But now let us look at it broadly. Maslow's hierarchy of needs? It suggests that a human has 5 needs that must be satisfied in a hierarchical order begining from the lowest to the highest. In order to satisfy these needs humans do what they must. However when one lower need is satisfied the next in hierarchy becomes a need. A very hungry man will even for to work for food. That does not mean that he is willing to work gor food only. As soon as he is full he will want other things like clothes, shoes, housing, etc. A person pressed to a corner would work for Uber no matter how low his take. Uber knows that that is why there was a time they would pay up to 800 dollars to get you convince friend or family to work for Uber. Now they pay 300 dollars. So when you get some one not knowing the city do not just give him a bad rating. Be gracious. It is only a gracious person that will give dignity and not take it away. That poor guy is trying his best to follow his American dream not knowing that he/she is a mere hapless pawn in the hands of the great shark called uber who pleases and woes her customers by using her drivers as mere fodder. I have much more to say but am afraid this is becoming too long. However I cannot resist wondering what holds us together as a nation. Our military are known for leaving no one behind. Why would we close our eyes to the plight of fellow Americans? Not long ago Apple was being taken to task for making their phones in China and paying very low wages why do we let Uber mistreat so many our country men and we keep quiet? It is cheap yes but would you sell your family for cheap stuff? Are we truely a Nation or have we gone back to the land of France before revolution? Are we gone back to creating bourgeoisie and the peasants classes all in the name of cheapness and convenience? Thanks for reading._x000D_Okonkwo""",1,2287,5484,2014-10-22

You will get to keep most of your money earned. I think the app works fine, would like to know where passenger is going before I take fare, but that's ok. I like the fact that I can drive when I want. I think most of these reviews are from taxi companies trying to take them out of business. No one ever is going to charge 300. for a 12 mile cab ride.

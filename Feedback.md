# Feedback Group 5

## Overall Feedback for Deliverable #2

I would recommmend creating a folder to put your Java files (`src` folder) and the `pom.xml` file in an app folder. While keeping the README file outside. Missing dataset and necessary files to parse the dataset and create entries on the database.

Points - 30/100

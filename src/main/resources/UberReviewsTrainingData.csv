And in a sense they are still more efficient than the dying breed of the cab industry. However there are and will continue to be more rideshare business. Look what Napster did to the music industry and look where Napster is now? Uber has gone down hill for me as this whole rating thing has gotten out of hand. I am on time for my driver, respectful (treating them the way I want to be treated), and despite not liking the tipping I still do it. I don't like the rating as it's pointless. If I give the driver a bad rating legitimately they will and have rated me poorly. Anything less than a 5/5 for a driver is \""wrong\"". So the passenger gets bullied into giving them a perfect score. Then there is this tipping which I have been in the service industry and support it but UBER was all about the no tipping and now if you don't tip enough or worse on time, the driver rates you poorly. Personally, I don't care if a drive likes me or not but when my rating can impact me getting a ride, this is where the problem is.Some examples I dealt with is I had a driver in Montreal who didn't speak English and I did the best I could to communicate in French and so my rating goes down. In Phoenix, my driver was soliciting his private driver business and when I couldn't use his same thing. And most recently in Seattle one driver was so depressing talking about how she has no friends and that she doesn't know Seattle well. I had to end up using my own gps using international Data and yet now I get a bad review. I was scared to give this lady a 4/5 yet alone worse. And I have gained other example.I have supported UBER coming to Calgary and Edmonton, even when they were booted out temporarily. Now that I live near Vancouver, I was supporting them coming there as well. Now, I'm starting to change my mind.My point is now I'm considering going with other options including the awkward hailing of a cab!

No problem with this fare.Got out of the Infinity SUV and we were on our way.Fast forward to two days later when I receive an email from Uber saying they made a fare adjustment. An adjustment in the amount of $175 for a cleaning fee. The driver filed an incident report with photos included stating I vomited in his vehicle. Photos that have no time or date stamps. There was no incident, his report is false. I have a witness who will attest that no incident occurred. I'm still disputing the charge in the amount of $175. Uber thinks it fine to allow one of their drivers file a false incident report against a customer and condones his dishonest behavior.

"{""text"":""I was an Uber driver in Raleigh,NC for 2 months a couple months after the launch just to check out what all the hype was about. First and foremost, driving for Uber is like working for about $10/hr(maybe) when you do the math. Uber charges riders in Raleigh $1.20 per mile. They pay their drivers 80percent of that or .96/mile. That is a mathmatical fact.As a driver,when you pick-up a passenger and drive them to their destination, you have to drive back to the hot pick-up area to get another fare.That's a fact. Raleigh is not New York City where you can pick up a rider,drive them across the city, and pick up another fare 5 blocks away. In Raleigh, you pick-up a rider, drive them 10 miles away,and then drive back the same 10 miles to get another fare(typically in downtown or local concerts etc). I did it and I know. I even camped out at the airport for 2 weeks from 7AM-10AM when 35 flights typically come in from big Uber markets. Very few calls to drive and I positioned myself so that I would be the first to be called because of an area I know about very close to the terminals. Back to the nasty math that Uber hates to talk about.Your .96/mile is now half that or .48/mile,because you have to drive back to pick-up another passenger. Gas in an efficient car is .15/per mile that you drive. Bro, now you are down to making .33/mile. Hardly what I call a good job part-time or otherwise considering you are wearing out your car driving people around. No BS what I have just told you here.Just the facts.1/16/2015 UPDATE!!!! Uber has now dropped their rider fees to .75/mile in Raleigh!! Amazing. Take everything I stated above regarding the money you can make at Uber as a driver and reduce it by over half now. They have added a bogus hourly guarantee(with conditions that are not within your ability to control)and have the gall to state that they are looking out for the drivers. Most drivers are actually losing money driving for Uber now,when they factor in gas and car expenses,nevermind making any money.People....You need to have your heads examined if you continue driving for Uber.

"{""text"":""Just started using Uber during a trip to Seattle this Summer.  During that trip, had a chance to use Uber about a dozen different times.  Then a half dozen trips in Portland, Oregon.  Just got back from a trip to New York, where I used Uber extensively, as well as a few rides on a \""Yellow\"" cab.  In every case, Uber was extremely convenient.  The vehicles were always on the new side, clean and comfortable.  The drivers were prompt, helpful (provided us with walking directions, information on places to check out, and warnings about areas that were \""sketchy,\"" etc).  Because your ride is paid for automatically via the app, there is never any fumbling with cash, credit card reader systems, etc.  Just get to your destination and go._x000D_The iPhone app is a breeze to set up and use.  It allows you to chose the type and size of vehicle you need, lets you know how long you will have to wait for your ride, and gives real-time location updates on the Uber you have requested.  It also gives you the name and customer ratings of your driver before you book the ride, notifies you as soon as your Uber arrives to pick you up, and allows you to contact your driver via cell if there are any issues.  You are always asked to rate your last driver before you can book a new ride, which assures that Uber has extensive customer feedback, but can slow things down a bit if you are trying to book your next ride in a hurry._x000D_Our experience using \""Yellow\"" cabs in many cities has not been great.  By and large, have always experienced long wait times when booking a cab by phone.  The standard seems to be \""your cab will be there in 15 to 45 minutes.\""  Usually, this works out to be 30 minutes plus.  Have also had issues with cabbies not wanting to do business with me when my ride is only a couple of miles or less.  In one case, had a cabbie whose car wouldn't start until AFTER we had gotten out of his car and jumped into another cab.  The cabs always seem to be \""vintage\"" - at least five years old  - poorly maintained and on the gritty side.  Our last experience with a cab ride was from La Guardia to New York's financial district.  It was like the Long Beach Grand Prix meets destruction derby.  Lots of jackrabbit starts, swerving in and out of traffic at high speed, slamming on brakes - all in a car that hadn't seen new shock absorbers in about a decade.  My wife and  I were both motion sick, but were too freaked out by our fast and furious driver to try fixing our eyes on the horizon._x000D_All-in-all, I am sold on Uber.

They have refunded us so far around $10.  When checking the distance to the airport it should've been $28.00.  Since then we have not heard from Uber. Specially with the last email asking for the email for head office.So we are done with the games, will be posting this note on all social media to let everybody know be aware of Uber ripping customers off and for their safety. Plus we will also be placing this on the website of the hotels that we were staying at.This could've been prevented if they communicated with us and reimbursed us the difference which they did not I guess money is more important than having a customer base._x000D_Josie and Gordon""}","[{""label"":""1"",""score"":1.0}]",3358ef21-07cb-4f19-b5cb-baaa3914b0dd,"{""text_length"":2736}",2019-07-06T00:00:00.000

Not enough pay, a lot of down time etc. For myself, Everytime I flip on the Uber app it's non stop, until I stop. However I live in Toronto and I only use it part time. I have a full time gig. If I work Uber its 2 to 4 hrs a night Monday to Thursday at \""rush hour\"".Friday I go 5pm until 10pm and start back up at 2-2:30am and work for a few more hours. Saturday repeat and Sunday is always busy up until 4pm. The rate varies for me but I base it by the day. It's been as low as $18 an hour and as high as $35 an hr. I don't always work the best times but I'm still averaging $21 an hr. After my first month. If you work the right times you can make $25-35 an hour, for me a perfect effortless part time job. The people are great. I always offer water and candy.  Anyway if you're reading this and contemplating just check it out what do you have to lose.

The greater Kansas City Missouri and Kansas metropolitan area people just LOVE riding with Uber and truly appreciate the higher level of service and safety that Uber delivers over the archaic taxi services.  Uber is also a very good company that treats its drivers with great respect.  The Uber app for Driver Partners is simply amazing and has evolved to include trip details, earning summaries and great rewards that rival many US Fortune 100's offerings.  As to earnings, Uber provides a real opportunity for drivers to make good money doing a highly rewarding job on a full-time or part-time basis.  At first, Uber will enter a market with a much lower price than the taxi services to help boost the customer base but they are also smart enough to know that price increases are also necessary to reflect the higher level of service that Uber delivers while still providing personal transportation at lower prices than taxis.  With the latest revolution in Kansas and Missouri Taxi Code to solidly position Uber in Kansas City for the longterm, drivers should expect to make hourly rates in excess of $30 per hour due to increased demand.  It's great to see that Uber, and Uber Riders, has elevated the job of driving for personal transportation to an attractive opportunity for students, single parents, single-mothers, veterans, ex-taxi drivers and anyone who wants to sup,went their income or make a good salary on a full-time basis.

"{""text"":""Recently use UBER to and from NY La Guardia Airport from my home in Riverdale, NY.  The fare was $17.00 higher on the return trip than going to the airport.  When I complained to UBEr, I was told that 'surge pricing\"" applied to my return trip.  Surge pricing is in effect during periods of high demand, high or heavy traffic,or bad weather.  None of these conditions applied.  In fact, we asked the driver upon pick up if it was particularly busy, and he confirmed clearly, it was not;  in fact he said it was extremely LIGHT.  There was absolutely no traffic on the trip from the airport to my home.   Conversely, on the trip TO the airport three days earlier, when my fare was $17.00 LOWER, the driver said traffic was extremely heavy and she took an alternate route to save time.  _x000D_I firmly belive UBER also uses their \""SURGE PRICING\"" as a means to increase revenue during normally quiet times, forcing customers to pay higher fares in order to make up for fewer rides requested.  I find this very disturbing and unethical.  Finally, in UBER's response to my complaint, I was told that the fare was displayed before I accepted the ride.  And while this is true, I needed a ride home and price gouging is improper and unethical in any situation.

Now I am advised that it means actually an additional 2.3 rate.  Even at that 2.3 rate $18x2.3=$41 not $68.97.  When I received the uber receipt after the fact I was charged $68.97.  I would have never agreed to this.  A normal cab ride was $40.  I feel violated and cheated by Uber. This system is not set up right and is very confusing for the customer.  I won't be using UBER again as the company after numerous attempts will not help.""}","[{""label"":""1"",""score"":1.0}]",a88b973e-0ac7-40cb-b193-2562888ab486,"{""text_length"":912}",2016-07-18T00:00:00.000

So your trip could take twice as long as it should, which means if you're late it's very hard to depend on Uber. 2)  It costs a lot. Some fares depending on how slow your driver is could be twice as much as normal cab. They also use \""surge pricing\"" which can increase the price of your fare. 3) Uber customer service has a bad attitude. Sort of like \""you're wrong, this is why we're right\"".

The app does all that for you and all you do is tap for a pick up request. Thank god for Google Maps.I prefer them over our local taxi cab drivers as most of them scare the hell out of us. Local taxi cab drives drive insanely fast, do unethical/safe maneuvers while driving, or turn the meter off (which is illegal in any state) and start shouting flat fee rates.  If this ever happens to you ask them to let you out where you are.  If they're an ass about the whole situation don't even pay them and contact their supervisor immediately to the company they are with.  This by US state law it is illegal to turn off the meter at any point a passenger is in the vehicle.  Report them to their manager after they leave. Request an uber or lyft service instead.""}","[{""label"":""3"",""score"":1.0}]",babfeb71-a39d-4f9c-9776-c28579dd929e,"{""text_length"":1808}",2019-08-25T00:00:00.000

Not knowing where she was, I had her open her Iberia app. Within minutes a immigrant driver had her in his vehicle and got on the phone with me to assure me he would get her safely to me. 18 minutes later the driver delivered my passed out little friend. She may never drink again, but we will certainly Uber. Thank You Uber!""}","[{""label"":""5"",""score"":1.0}]",bebddcb6-9598-4373-8f56-e65ec8dccbee,"{""text_length"":630}",2015-11-02T00:00:00.000
"{""text"":""I recently had two incidents that shaped my many reason not to spend any more money with Uber. In New York, Uber is more popular among the natives than taking a train. Which is great, when dealing with the harsh winter. The issue is the service coming from the Uber drivers and Uber's customer service. Most recently I took a Uber ride to Far Rockaway, NY to Queens, NY which was a $50 dollar Uber pool. The car was very cold and in the beginning the Uber driver was very quiet. Once we got closer the destination the Uber driver began to get confused on what route to take. As I asked to make a right at the next light he turned around while driving and began to yell at me. We were on a parkway in Far Rockaway with cars driving all around us. He began to shout and hits brake twice jerking me from out of the seat. He begins to curse me out and tell me to shut up until we get there or he will make walk.

No one is in charge of me to tell me when  to drive or where to drive. And for those of you who complain about the maintenance on your car. Well, You should be keeping the maintenance on it any way. No wonder most of you got engine trouble. Using your car while working is a huge tax advantage.  Oh insurance.... You are required by law to have that any way. A little extra coverage may be required but to me its worth it. _x000D_Some drivers have bad experiences with  driving for Uber. If you drive in a bad area guess what you gonna get bad riders.

It started a little ruff in the beginning because you have to get to know the GPS and that sometimes it goes crazy in certain places and you don't know what to do but do my best to get the rider to his destination safe. So I had a few problems and some customers are not fair weather they are having a bad day or not feeling well or just disgusted with life itself. Uber should really try to communicate with there partners and see if they can help a driver and hear what they say about the passenger. I own a 2001 2 door Acura and I had to purchase a newer vehicle to drive and so the passengers were comfortable my way of providing good service. I did my best and that was not good enough because of how customers rated us and there comments. The sad part was that I rated almost everybody with a 5 star ratting. So I get an email that my account was deactivated . I was loving my job and was trying to improve without  Uber help. I lost a job I love due to customers with no heart and a company that does not care about the uber driver. _x000D_I hope this help someone and be careful cause the Uber driver has more to loose.

More often than not, it does not recognize that I have arrived at the pick-up point and can begin the trip.  So, rather than make the rider wait I will begin the trip.  But this means that the navigation system won't initiate to give directions.  And, just as frequently, the app doesn't recognize that you have arrived at the destination so you can end the trip.  Uber's answer is to employ a small army of workers to make adjustments to the ride beginning/ending and the associated fare after the fact.  When I first started with Uber (only two months ago), the app worked well (80% of the time).  Now, the above noted glitches occur 90% of the time.

Maybe another potential customer not sure.  I got the receipt and was charge $179 for the short trip.  When I contacted UBER they said since it was busy they could charge me 3.6 times the normal fair.  That is really taking advantage of your customers.
